cool visualization chart
when you see how one videos links to other recommendations
so like instead of a social graph have a recommended videos graph

what differentiates vekii from youtube?
it's the social network stupid
youtube meets twitter or facebook or github
be able to copy a playlist but have like a filter option,
a chance to eliminate songs from the playlist you don't like
so just have like a new link next to the video (havn't listened)
apply the new to recommendations as well

or should it just be a recommended option like
connect to last.fm
some kind of API

should i get recommendations then go through that recommendations
or should i get choose where to get recommendations from
how do we normally listen to music?
do we need to interact socially when listening to music?
wait, it's kind of like that startup where you have DJ's streaming music

add a news about the site panel
add a feedback method
0 olark?

start trying to get beta users

are you going to store data on rails-backend?
- best to use youtube as data storage, less work to do
		two options:
		- use youtube to store playlist
			- make users wait for the ajax call
